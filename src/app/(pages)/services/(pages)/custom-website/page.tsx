        <h2>What is Custom Code for Healthcare Websites?</h2>
        <p>
          Custom code is all about building your website from the ground up,
          tailored specifically to your needs. Unlike pre-built templates or
          page builders, custom code gives you full control over every aspect of
          your website. Here’s what that means:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-image-[url(/icons/check.png)]">
          <li>
            <b>Tailored Design:</b> Your website will look exactly the way you
            envision it, with no compromises. Every element, from layout to
            color scheme, is designed to reflect your brand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Optimized Performance:</b> Hand-coded websites are leaner and
            faster because they don’t rely on bloated code from templates or
            plugins. This results in quicker load times and a smoother user
            experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Enhanced Security:</b> Custom code reduces vulnerabilities by
            avoiding common security issues found in generic templates or
            plugins, which are often targeted by hackers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Scalability:</b> As your practice grows, your website can easily
            adapt. Custom code allows for seamless updates and the addition of
            new features without the limitations of pre-built systems.
          </li>

        <h2>How Can a Custom Website Help Your Medical Practice?</h2>
        <p>
          A custom website isn’t just about looking good—it’s about enhancing
          the overall efficiency and effectiveness of your practice. Here’s how
          a custom-built website can benefit your medical practice:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-image-[url(/icons/check.png)]">
          <li>
            <b>Improved Patient Experience:</b> A custom website is designed
            with your patients in mind. From easy navigation to fast load times,
            every detail is crafted to provide a positive user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Brand Consistency:</b> Your website is a reflection of your
            practice. Custom code allows for a consistent brand experience,
            which helps build trust with your patients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Better SEO Performance:</b> Custom websites are built with search
            engines in mind. We ensure that your site’s structure, speed, and
            content are optimized to rank higher in search results, helping more
            patients find you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Unique Functionality:</b> Whether it’s an online booking system,
            patient portals, or custom forms, a hand-coded website allows you to
            offer unique features that cater to your specific needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compliance and Accessibility:</b> Healthcare websites need to
            comply with regulations such as HIPAA and accessibility standards
            like WCAG. Custom coding allows us to ensure your site meets all
            necessary requirements.

        <h2>Why We Don’t Like WordPress or Any Page Builder</h2>
        <p>
          While WordPress and page builders are popular options for many
          websites, they’re not always the best choice for healthcare providers.
          Here’s why we prefer custom code over WordPress or any other page
          builder:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-image-[url(/icons/check.png)]">
          <li>
            <b>Performance Issues:</b> WordPress sites can be slow due to the
            heavy use of plugins and themes that aren’t optimized for speed.
            This can lead to long load times, frustrating your patients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Security Vulnerabilities:</b> WordPress is a common target for
            hackers, especially if plugins and themes aren’t regularly updated.
            Custom-coded websites are less prone to such attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Limited Customization:</b> While WordPress offers a lot of
            plugins, they can only take you so far. Custom code allows for
            complete freedom in design and functionality, without being
            restricted by the limitations of a theme or plugin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Unnecessary Bloat:</b> WordPress sites often come with a lot of
            unnecessary code, which can slow down your site and make it harder
            to maintain. Custom code is leaner, faster, and easier to manage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Maintenance Challenges:</b> Managing a WordPress site often
            requires frequent updates, plugin management, and troubleshooting.
            With custom code, you have a cleaner, more streamlined site that’s
            easier to maintain.

        <h2>WordPress vs. Custom Code</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to building a website for your medical practice, the
